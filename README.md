# Metallic Ratios and Continued Fractions Research

## Overview

This repository contains my independent research into metallic ratios, continued fractions, and their connections to mathematical constants and number theory. The work includes:

- Explorations of golden, silver, and bronze ratios
- Continued fraction expansions of primes and irrationals
- Python notebooks demonstrating properties and patterns
- LaTeX writeups and formal research summaries

I began this work after studying Calculus II and III at the university level while in middle school. I am currently 13 years old and passionate about math, science, and research that challenges conventional thinking.

## ðŸ“„ Papers & Writeups

- `metallic_ratios_summary.pdf`: My formal write-up on the relationships between metallic means and continued fractions.
- `prime_fraction_patterns.pdf`: Notes and visualizations from my exploration into prime-based continued fraction sequences.

## ðŸ”¢ Notebooks & Code

- `fibonacci_ratio.ipynb`: A Python notebook showing convergence of Fibonacci ratios to the golden ratio.
- `metallic_matrix.py`: Code demonstrating metallic mean generation using matrix methods.

## ðŸ“š Background

This project is part of my long-term goal to qualify for programs like MIT PRIMES and to pursue mathematical research as a high school student.
